ejs means Embedded JavaScript template
It is a .ejs file
It is denoted using <%= [nameOfVariable in .js file] %>

Download it in the directory using npm i.e. npm install ejs

ejs is used to create reusable templates(list.ejs in this case)

check ejs.com for some more documentations on when to use control tags like <%= %>, <% %>, <%- %> and so on

For example: <% 'Scriplet' tag for control-flow no output is wrapped around each line(begining and end of the each line) of code that is JavaScript if mixed with say HTML


app.set('view engine', 'ejs'); is IMPORTANT after const app = express();



For the date format used, it was gotten from StackOverflow


public folder is always created to hold folders like css, JavaScript etc because express should be coded to find them EXPLICITLY.
css folder/file for example is located as thus immediately after "app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({extended: true}));
i.e app.use(express.static("public"));
